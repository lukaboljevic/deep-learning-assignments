# Simple LSTM and Transformer

This homework is about implementing a LSTM RNN and simplified version of the original Transformer for character-level text generation. The LSTM is currently only single layered, but it can (and should) be expanded to a multi layered for better results.

The implementation can be found on this [Google Colab link](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1F12GUl1cC-1QIXBSBpAf9CCCznnjZF6n?usp=sharing).
